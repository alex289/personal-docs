The [CrowdSec Security Engine](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) is an open-source, lightweight software that detects and blocks malicious actors from accessing your systems at various levels, using log analysis and threat patterns called scenarios.

![Crowdsec architecture](https://docs.crowdsec.net/img/crowdsec_architecture.png)

## Installation

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crowdsec
```

### Recommended collections, parsers and scenarios

### Bouncer

CrowdSec itself is not a blocking solution, it's a detection engine. To block IPs, you need to install a bouncer. You can find a list of available bouncer [here](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/bouncers). To install the firewall bouncer, run one of the following commands, depending on your firewall:

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-iptables
# or
sudo apt install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-nftables
```

### Support Docker

If you are using Docker, you need to modify the bouncer configuration to block requests to Docker containers. Edit the file `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml` and uncomment the line `FORWARD` in the `iptables_chains`.

## Configuration

To parse logs, you need to install a parser. You can find a list of available parsers [here](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/collections). After that you need to configure the parser to parse the logs you want by editign the file `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml`.

### Example for nginx

```bash
cscli collections install crowdsecurity/nginx
```

```yaml
# /etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml
---
source: docker
container_name:
  - nginx
labels:
  type: nginx
```

### Create own ip whitelist

You can create your own ip whitelist by creating the file `/etc/crowdsec/parsers/s02-enrich/mywhitelists.yaml`.

```yaml
name: crowdsecurity/whitelists
description: 'Whitelist events from my ip addresses'
whtielist:
  reason: 'my ip ranges'
  ip:
    - '1.1.1.1'
    - '10.0.0.0/8'
    - '172.16.0.0/12'
    - '192.168.0.0/16'
```
